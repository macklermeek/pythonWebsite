# Curling Simulator onboarding website
## This website will serve as onbaoarding for future students or anyone curious about our research.
## In our research we are using a physics simulator and python. There will be interactive models throughout the page for both the physics and python.

## Features
- interactive models
- in depth documentation of both python and physics 
- page to download all software needed 
- Team page

# Tech
This website along with the curing simulator uses a few open source project to work
- <ins>Python 3</ins> - All the coding you will do and see will be in python
- <ins>Pip</ins> - This is so you are able to install the virtual environment (this is typically installed when python is installed)
- <ins>Pipenv</ins> -This is for virtual environments to install our application depencdies without interuppting others projects 
- <ins>Visual studio code(Vs code)</ins> - This is an app to do all the coding once you feel comfortable
- <ins>Django</ins> - This is a python backend for our websites
- <ins>MuJoCo</ins> - Physics engine used for simulator
- <ins>MuJoCoPy</ins> - Python frontend to support the simulator
- <ins>Github</ins> - Allows for easy collaboration (optional)

## Installation
For django to run you will need to install python

You can install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To make sure the download was successful type:

|OS| Command |
|---|---|
|Mac|python3 --verison|
|Windows| python --verison|

If pip is not installed you can run:

|OS| Command |
|---|---|
|Mac|python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade|
|Windows|py -m ensurepip --upgrade|

or 

|OS| Command |
|---|---|
|Mac|python3 get-pip.py|
|Windows|py get-pip.py|


Now install pipenv type:

|OS| Command |
|---|---|
|Mac|pip3 install pipenv|
|Windows|pip install pipenv|


Either in the terminal or command prompt type:

|Command|All Os|
|---|---|
|mkdir| directoryName|

Then type to enter the directory you just created:

|Command|All Os|
|---|---|
|cd| directoryName|

Now to use django you will need to create a virtual environment and download django within that environment type:

|OS| Command |
|---|---|
|Mac|pip3 install pipenv|
|Windows|pip install pipenv|

Open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) commonly refered as VS code and open your folder that you just created

Install python extension
