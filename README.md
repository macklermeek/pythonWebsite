- page to download all software needed 
- Team page

# Tech
This website along with the curing simulator uses a few open source project to work
- [Python 3] - All the coding you will do and see will be in python
- [Vs code] - This is an app to do all the coding once you feel comfortable
- [Django] - This is a python backend for our websites
- [MuJoCo] - Physics engine used for simulator
- [MuJoCoPy] - Python frontend to support the simulator
- [Github] - Allows for easy collaboration (optional)

## Installation
For django to run you will need to install python

You can install [Python 3] (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
